- About Me:
Hello World! My name is Henrique Matias, and I'm a beginner in the world of programming. I have a interest in statistics, and my main focus is on data science with a specialization in machine learning.
Currently, I'm an undergraduate student in Computational Physics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), starting in the year 2023. 
I'm excited to explore the fascinating field of data science and its applications in various domains. 

- Projects:
I'm still in the early stages of my programming and data science journey, but I'm working on some interesting projects.
Soon, I'll be sharing my projects related to data analysis, visualization, and implementation of machine learning models.
Stay tuned to keep up with my ever-evolving projects.

- Contributions:
As a beginner, I haven't had the opportunity to make significant contributions to open-source projects yet.
I'm looking forward to improving my skills and collaborating with the developer community in the near future.
